We are a small team (just two people) of blockchain enthusiasts that has been exploring the space since 2017 and believe in the future of proof-of-stake systems.

In 2019, we started validating on various testnet networks including [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/), [Coda Protocol](https://codaprotocol.com/), [Althea](https://althea.net/), Mictotick, [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re/) and [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/).

In November 2019, we launched our first mainnet validator for [Kava](https://www.kava.io/).

We find inspiration in fellow independent validators like [@cjremus](https://twitter.com/cjremus) and [@cryptomeleabs](https://twitter.com/cryptomeleabs) and believe that smaller validators should have more power and wider participation in POS systems.
