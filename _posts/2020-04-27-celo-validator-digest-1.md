One of the troubles we have faced as a validator for [Celo](https://celo.org/) is keeping up with all the information that comes up in the Celo's [Discord](https://discord.gg/6yWMkgM) discussions. This is particularly true for smaller validators whose portfolios include several networks. To help everyone stay in the loop with what is going on the Celo validator scene and contribute to the validator and broader Celo community, we have decided to start the **Celo Discord Validator Digest**. Here are the notes for the period of 22-26 April.

## Useful info

* If you want to use ledger and connect to a remote node to perform commands from it, the forno for RC1 is available at [https://rc1-forno.celo-testnet.org/](https://rc1-forno.celo-testnet.org/). The plan is to move it to [https://forno.celo.org](https://forno.celo.org) later.

* Celostats is available at [https://stats.celo.org/](https://stats.celo.org/). Unfortunately, many validators have complained that their validator names regularly disappear from the dashboard. It is usually fixed by restarting Docker container on your proxy (and sometimes on the validator machine too).

* Important note about rotating keys before rewards/transfer are activated:

> **[@asa / cLabs](https://discordapp.com/channels/600834479145353243/697229909545713775/703212256812335114)**: [I] suggest **not** doing key rotation yet. The RG contract will fund your **first** authorized signers with 1 cGLD for tx fees. If you key rotate, the second signer will not have any way to pay for tx fees until cGLD transfers are enabled.

​		Also, for those who locked entire amounts of cGLD on their RG account(s):

The authorization fails b/c the RG contract has no cGLD to send the authorized signer. You'll need to unlock 2 cGLD, and withdraw it in 3 days, and then you will be able to proceed. Well really just 1 cGLD.

* If you want to lock accounts on your accounts node, you can perform the following commands to first list locked/unlocked accounts:

```
docker exec -it celo-accounts geth attach --exec 'personal.listWallets'
```

​		and then lock them:

```
docker exec -it celo-accounts geth attach --exec 'personal.lockAccount("<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>")'
```

* If you have errors when executing `celocli` commands, prepend it with `DEBUG=*` so you can investigate errors further.

* In order to give a name to your group and validator, please refer to the following two commands:

```
celocli releasegold:set-account --contract $CELO_VALIDATOR_GROUP_RG_ADDRESS --property name --value <GROUP_NAME>
```

```
celocli releasegold:set-account --contract $CELO_VALIDATOR_RG_ADDRESS --property name --value <VALIDATOR_NAME>
```


## Errors

If you're getting one of these error messages, there's nothing to worry about:

```

* If your are checking the status of your validator with `celocli validator:status --validator $CELO_VALIDATOR_RG_ADDRESS` and you see `false` in the `Frontrunner` field, don't freak out. This is because the election has not been activated yet. The output of the command actually say this: `Warning: Elections not available`.

* If your validator paints a picture similar to the one below, and your logs look fine, here are possible explanations of the issue:

Remember, your score is only impacted if you miss 12 blocks in a row, which doesn't seem to be close to happening. While we should absolutely diagnose and fix this issue I don't think it's any cause for alarm.

> **[@victor / cLabs](https://discordapp.com/channels/600834479145353243/601046166620078100/703708914721619988):** Based on the pattern, it's most likely that it has someone to do with a particular validator, and doesn't indicate anything wrong with your machine. We know 3 validators are currently offline, and that is likely the root cause, but we will know once we've investigated further. Because it is isolated blocks, it won't affect your uptime score.

* The notorious "preprepare" issue from the Great Celo Stake-Off is considered for closure: [https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/issues/808](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/issues/808)
