Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and growing economic pains, our team kept on working hard to support the networks we have joined. Read on to learn about the launch of **Celo** and **Centrifuge**, our participation in another **Regen Network**'s testnet and other updates.

Following our participation in the [Great Celo Stake Off](https://forum.celo.org/t/the-great-celo-stake-off-the-details/136) competition, we first supported the [Celo's](celo.org) new Baklava testnet and then, on April 22, were among a group of genesis validators who made the [launch](https://twitter.com/marekolszewski/status/1252999639738888193) of Celo's Release Candidate 1 network possible. When it became evident that the network was stable, and several crucial governance proposals (to unfreeze election contract, enable voter rewards and cGLD transfers) have been passed, the RC1 network successfully graduated into the mainnet on May 18. To celebrate the moment, cLabs presented a [nice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEARt0AxyoU) of the validator community sharing their experience of making the goal of financial inclusion come true (which features us among others).

As one of the Stake Off winners our validator group received votes from the Celo Foundation and cLabs for the next 3 months. Votes from other groups and voters followed, making us one of the [top 30 groups](http://thecelo.com/).

One of the troubles we have faced as a validator for Celo is keeping up with all the information that comes up in the Celo's Discord discussions. This is especially true for smaller validators whose portfolios include several networks. To help everyone stay in touch with what is going on the Celo validator scene and contribute to the validator and broader Celo community, we have decided to publish the weekly [Celo Discord Validator Digest](https://moonlime.substack.com/). So far, the response to our initiative has been amazing, with subscriptions and views constantly growing. The incredibly positive feedback from the readers reassures us that the community is deeply interested in the updates from the validator scene.

On May 22, we participated in the (now virtual) Celo's Prosper Retreat [discussion panel](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/prosper-7) on validating POS networks.

Our group has also decided to donate 10% of its validator rewards to various projects and charities.

We are super excited to be a part of Celo and its mission and looking forward to further milestones and the subsequent launch of the Celo mobile wallet.

[Centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io/) is introducing a whole new way to finance assets and unlock capital for the next generation of finance. Through Centrifuge, borrowers can access bankless liquidity, and investors can earn attractive yields from an open marketplace of asset pools.

Centrifuge provides the gateway to access DeFi liquidity using its suite of open source tools: Tinlake, Centrifuge Chain and a P2P Protocol.

The Centrifuge's vision will see a cheaper and more accessible global business network, built on a financial operating system fit for the 21st century.

We have been supporting Centrifuge since mid-January, on the [Flint](https://portal.chain.centrifuge.io/#?rpc=wss://fullnode.flint.centrifuge.io) and [Amber](https://portal.chain.centrifuge.io/#?rpc=wss://fullnode.amber.centrifuge.io) testnets and became one of the genesis validators for the soft-launch of the main network in early April.

In late April, Centrifuge submitted applications to include two of its pilot projects with [Paperchain](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/pc-drop-mip6-application-paperchain-drop-tokenized-music-streaming-invoices/2215) and [ConsolFreight](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/cf-drop-mip6-application-consolfreight-drop-tokenized-freight-shipping-invoices/2214) into MakerDAO's Improvement Proposals. The applications were approved, and Centrifuge's DROP tokens for Paperchain and ConsolFreight were put to a vote by the Maker community that will decide whether to add them as collateral in the protocol.  

In early May, Centrifuge became a member of the [Celo Alliance for Prosperity](https://medium.com/celoorg/alliance-for-prosperity-73-members-strong-first-integrations-live-d397faa344b2), a development we are very excited about. With Centrifuge's technology Celo should now be able to diversify its Stability Reserve with real-world assets.

On May 26, the Centrifuge's mainnet was officially launched, marking the public availability of its protocol and suite of tools for Decentralized Asset Financing.

We are really excited about the endless opportunities that Centrifuge opens for the DeFi space and its mainstream adoption and looking forward to support this journey.

We've been supporting [Regen Network's](https://www.regen.network/) testnets since last August.

In March-April, we took part in the Regen's [**Kontra≈≠a**](https://medium.com/regen-network/cosmwasm-kontra%C5%ADa-testnet-plan-2756490ccdf4) tetsnet. The main objectives of this network was to practice upgrades and skipping upgrades, edit and deploy smart contracts and tolerate spam transactions as well as DDOS attacks.

This was the most difficult Regen testnet so far with validators being required not just to run nodes but also to demonstrate some coding skills. Our performance this time was far from perfect, yet we still managed to get enough points to stay in the top 10 in the [leaderboard](https://regen.vitwit.com/).

The next testnet is scheduled to take place in June and will pave the way to the launch of the main network.

As we mentioned in the [previous recap](https://moonli.me/articles/2020-03/moonlime-recap-dec-feb), we joined Kusama's [100 Validator Programme](https://polkadot.network/join-kusamas-thousand-validators-programme/) in February and were included in the first cohort of the program participants in early April.

We have been successfully validating the network since then, boasting the highest rating among [all program participants](https://thousand-validators.kusama.network/#/leaderboard). We also managed to attract several nominators apart from the Web3 Foundation.

In addition to validating per se, we actively participate in governance and haven't missed a single referendum since joining the set.

We also passed the formal verification procedure and had our identity and contact details confirmed by one of the registrars.

 If you are a KSM holder, we encourage you to support our validator:

    {% raw %}
    GCNHHRBtpDcgADCaRPMNNk52JiitGrcv3DMQxwE6owXAfbt
    {% endraw %}

 Also, just a few days ago the [Polkadot network](https://polkadot.network/) went live after being in development for over three years. We are currently in the process of spinning up our validator for Polkadot and should be among the candidate validators in a few days. Since the network is in PoA mode, and transactions are still disabled, it is impossible to set validator identities, which makes the process of nominating not very convenient. Therefore, if you would like to nominate your DOTS to our validator, keep an eye on our stash address:

     {% raw %}
     14DtSJnpB1qx3HPHzZTDBApLVStznVb9B3HRaUgWSyG74feC
     {% endraw %}

 It's been over six months since the launch of [Kava Labs](https://www.kava.io/)' mainnet in November, and our validator has been up and running with 99.99 percent uptime.

 This means that we fully qualified for the Founder Plus Badge that we successfully received from Kava's team in late May.

<img title="Founder Badge" alt="Founder Badge" src="/img/founder-plus.png" width="250">

Also in May, [we joined](https://testnet.kava.bigdipper.live/validator/kavavaloper1xjkd52fka9jyrv2085q3kf38ec42sgcyjw09xe) Kava's testnet-6000 that is the final step before the CDP functionality hits the mainnet. In addition to this, we voted **"yes"** for proposals 3-7 that are aimed at nominating Kava Oracle Providers, adding BNB as collateral to Kava platform and adding USDX minting rewards for BNB, creating the Kava Stability Committee and nominating its members, and voting for the upgrade of the network to enable the
CDP functionality.

Given the lack of delegations from Kava token holders, and the Kava Foundation being our only supporter, we have started the process of gradual increase in our commission rate until it hits the maximum of 30%. This step will allow us to ensure the minimum economic feasibility of running the validator on the Kava network. If we receive any sizable delegation, this process may be reversed.

If you would like to support our mainnet validator, you can delegate your Kavas to our operator's address:

     {% raw %}
     kavavaloper1kc6vzheht92jwf0gtzhjk6jjht67rxhal9z04v
     {% endraw %}

In addition to these networks, we are hoping to join [Coda Protocol](https://codaprotocol.com/) at launch as one of the Genesis Members. We also successfully completed participation in the NuCypher's [Come and Stake It (CASI) Incentivized Testnet](https://blog.nucypher.com/come-and-stake-it-incentivized-testnet/), continue participating in Oasis Protocol's [Quest](https://www.oasis-protocol.org/quest) and joined [Pocket Network's](https://www.pokt.network/) incentivized testnet.

We have also unbonded and stopped our validator for [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re/) due to lack of resources and active participation in other projects.

This is all for now. Share this post to support us, [follow us](https://twitter.com/moonli_me) to stay up to date and watch out for future updates!
